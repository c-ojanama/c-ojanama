    <!-- About Section -->
    <section id="about" class="section">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an <strong>18-year-old undergraduate student</strong> pursuing a Bachelor's degree in 
        <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> at <strong>Wright State University</strong>, expected to graduate in Spring 2026.
        I take pride in maintaining a strong <strong>work-life balance</strong>, focusing on productivity, growth, and purpose
        in everything I do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of academics, I’m passionate about <strong>running, technology, and investing</strong>. I enjoy following 
        current events, spending time outdoors and with family, and using technology—especially <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>—to
        create tools that simplify and enhance everyday life.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Projects Section -->
    <section id="projects" class="section light">
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        My most notable completed project to date is the creation of a <strong>multilingual large language model (LLM)</strong>
        that integrates <strong>OpenAI’s Whisper</strong> for speech recognition and a custom-trained <strong>BERT model</strong>
        for instruction interpretation and response generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This system was designed to understand commands in multiple languages, translate them into English, and
        provide both the translated question and answer in English alongside the user’s original language.
        The BERT model was fine-tuned on over <strong>12,000 training commands</strong>, optimizing it for real-time 
        multilingual comprehension and response accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project involved developing and testing a full audio pipeline — from capturing microphone input to
        transcribing speech with Whisper, tokenizing inputs for BERT, and classifying or generating responses.
        The final product successfully demonstrated multilingual voice-to-text understanding and AI-driven reasoning,
        forming the foundation for a universal voice assistant framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m continuing to expand this work into related areas such as <strong>natural language understanding, robotics integration, and intelligent automation</strong>.
      </p>

    <!-- Involvements Section -->
    <section id="involvements" class="section">
      <h2>Involvements</h2>
      <p>
        I’m currently a member of the <strong>TARS Research Group</strong> at Wright State University, where I collaborate 
        on research related to <strong>robotics, automation, and AI-driven systems</strong>. This involvement has deepened my 
        understanding of engineering design principles and interdisciplinary teamwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond research, I seek opportunities that encourage <strong>human interaction, collaboration, and leadership</strong>.
        I believe that growth happens through contribution, and I’m drawn to environments that combine innovation, 
        real-world problem-solving, and team-driven progress.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Investments Section -->
    <section id="investments" class="section light">
      <h2>Investments</h2>
      <p>
        My investment philosophy centers on <strong>technology, innovation, and long-term sustainability</strong>.
        I currently manage two active investment accounts that have each achieved gains of up to 
        <strong>30% in under a year</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My portfolio primarily focuses on <strong>tech-based companies</strong> that align with both my personal interests and
        the future of our economy. I also participate in the <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> space on a smaller scale—mainly
        through <strong>Bitcoin</strong>—which I view as an evolving and transformative financial technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I approach investing with a mindset of <strong>continuous learning and risk awareness</strong>, guided by market data,
        trends in emerging technologies, and a disciplined, research-backed strategy.
      </p>
